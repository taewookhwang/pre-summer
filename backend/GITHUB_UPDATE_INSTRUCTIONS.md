# GitHub Update Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for updating the GitHub repository with all standardization changes.

## Preparation

1. Ensure you have the latest version of the repository:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Create a new branch for the standardization changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/backend-standardization
   ```

3. Review the `COMPLETE_FILE_LIST.md` file to ensure you have all the required files.

## Adding Files

1. Add all new and modified files to staging:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   Alternatively, you can add files selectively based on the categories in `COMPLETE_FILE_LIST.md`:
   ```bash
   # Core configuration files
   git add package.json eslint.config.cjs prettier.config.cjs jsdoc.json .eslintrc.js .prettierignore CODING_STANDARDS.md README.md RELEASE_NOTES.md

   # Infrastructure files
   git add Infrastructure/

   # Shared modules
   git add Shared/

   # Gateway service
   git add Gateway/

   # Service modules
   git add Services/

   # Documentation
   git add docs/

   # Database scripts
   git add initDb.js seedCategories.js seedServices.js seedUsers.js

   # Tests
   git add tests/
   ```

2. Verify that all files are staged:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

## Committing Changes

1. Create a commit with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Implement backend standardization

   - Add standardized logging system
   - Add environment configuration management
   - Implement code style standardization with ESLint and Prettier
   - Add standardized error handling
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Reorganize folder structure
   - Remove code duplication
   - Standardize API responses"
   ```

## Creating a Pull Request

1. Push the branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/backend-standardization
   ```

2. Go to the GitHub repository and create a new pull request:
   - Base branch: `main`
   - Compare branch: `feature/backend-standardization`
   - Title: "Backend Standardization Implementation"
   - Description: Include a summary of changes from `RELEASE_NOTES.md`

3. Request reviews from team members.

## Review Process

During the review process:

1. Address any feedback by making additional commits to the branch.
2. Re-run linting and tests to ensure all changes meet the standards:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm test
   ```
3. Update the branch after making changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/backend-standardization
   ```

## Merging the Changes

Once the pull request has been approved:

1. Merge the pull request on GitHub (prefer "Squash and merge" for a clean history).
2. Delete the feature branch after merging.

## Post-Merge Tasks

After the changes have been merged:

1. Pull the latest changes to your local main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Create tag for the release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Backend Standardization Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. Notify team members about the update and point them to the documentation.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter conflicts during the merge:

1. Pull the latest changes from the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/backend-standardization
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Resolve conflicts and commit the changes:
   ```bash
   # After resolving conflicts
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   ```

3. Push the updated branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/backend-standardization
   ```

## Important Notes

- The standardization changes are extensive, affecting the entire backend architecture.
- All team members should review the documentation to understand the new standards.
- Service owners should verify that their services continue to function properly after the update.
- New development should follow the patterns defined in the documentation.
